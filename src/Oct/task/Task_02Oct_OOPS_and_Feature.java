   /*OOPS --Object oriented programming  refers to the  language that use objects in programming.
    OOPS aims to implement real world entities like inheritance,hiding,polymorphism in programming.
    Main aim of OOPS to bind together the data and the function that operates on them so that no other part of code
    can access this data except that function.


    OOPS feature

    1) classes and objects-Classes are blueprint to create objects
    which defines properties and behaviour of an object.
    object are the instance of the class

    2) Abstraction - It is about the providing the necessary information/feature of an  object
    and hiding all complex implementation details.
    Its helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

    3)  Encapsulation - binding all the data and methods together to a single unit called class,
    providing controlled access of data

    4) Inheritance- This feature allows the new class to inherit the properties and the methods
    from the existing class.Its helps in reusing the code and establishing relationship between different classes.

    5)polymorphism-one interface controlling multiple behaviour based on the objects.
